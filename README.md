# IPLogger
Log the ip changes when using a proxy or a VPN.

This program uses the ipdata API. Please follow the instructions to make the application work:

1. Register on https://ipdata.co/
2. Create a "key.txt" file on desktop.
3. Paste inside the "key.txt" file the API key you get from https://ipdata.co/
4. Launch the application.

The program was made by Akulav. 
The application icon was made by Martz90 from https://iconarchive.com/show/circle-icons-by-martz90/books-icon.html. The application is open-sourced and free and follows the artist's rules for using it.
